			<h5>What’s the difference between Google One and Google Drive?</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Google Drive is a storage service. Google One is a subscription plan that gives you more storage to use across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos. What's more, with Google One, you receive extra benefits and can share your membership with your family.

            How you use Google Drive doesn’t change, so you don’t have to worry about losing or transferring anything.</p>

			<h5>How does the storage I get with Google One compare to what I get for free?</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Every Google Account starts with 15 GB of free storage that’s shared across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos. When you upgrade to Google One, your total storage will increase to 100 GB or more, depending on which plan you choose. You'll also get extra member benefits and access to support from Google experts – all of which you can share with your family.</p>

			<h5>How can I use Google One if I’m not a member?</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>As a free Google One user, you can back up data on your Android phone, and also free up space in your Google Account using the storage manager. If you get a Google One membership, you’ll unlock additional features, such as expanded cloud storage, support from our team of Google experts and exclusive benefits.</p>

			<h5>With who, can I share my Google One membership?</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You can share Google One with up to five additional family members at no extra cost (that's six in total, including you). When you create a new family group, you can add or remove other family members.

If you’re already a member of a family group on Google, you can share your Google One plan with the rest of your existing group.</p>

			<h5>What do I share with my family group? Can they see everything I've stored?</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You can share all the benefits of Google One with your family group – without sharing any of your personal files. Family members will share the storage space that comes with your Google One plan, but your family group won't be able to see what you store unless you specifically share it with them from Google Drive, Gmail or Google Photos.</p>
